        <h2> About Me </h2>        
            <p> My name is Joshua Mangerino. I was born in England, but grew up in California.
            I love playing video games and reading books. I am currently taking a class at
            Universty of Utah for Web Devlopment. Hoping to change my career to something to do with
            Web Devlopment. Because I haven't done a lot of projects yet, I have added place 
            holders for now, and eventually I will go back and change them to future projects.
